              <p class="animation delay1 fadeInUp" align="left">The first thing that Evan ever said to Christina was "so I hear we're going to get married". In response to which, Christina immediately thought "what a presumptuous ass".</p>

              <p class="animation delay2 fadeInUp" align="left">In the age of OkCupid, Tinder, Catkaller, Snugglebugs, and eHarmony... Christina and Evan were given a 99% matching by an even more sophisticated algorithm... the minds of their friends Ben Ross and Melanie Duve. Upon first meeting, Christina remained skeptical (see above paragraph) and Evan was smitten (see above paragraph). It didn't take too long, however, for Christina to realize what had been obvious to everyone else, that she and Evan were perfect together.</p>

              <p class="animation delay3 fadeInUp" align="left">10 months later, Evan made good on those first words to Christina...all it took was a board game, a fireplace, and a ring.</p>
