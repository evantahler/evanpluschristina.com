              <h2>Evan</h2>
              <p>(as described by Christina)</p>
              
              <p>Evan is the worst at accepting compliments…which is unbelievably frustrating as I constantly want to be telling him the thousand and one different ways that I think he is amazing.  He is the smartest, kindest, most thoughtful man I’ve ever met. He is my favorite adventure buddy, hand holder, and board game opponent.</p>  

              <p>I can only assume that Evan is a robot that my friend built for me after deciding I had been single for too long, as this is the only possible explanation for him being so perfect. </p>

              <h2>Christina</h2>
              <p>(as described by Evan)</p>

              <p>Christina is the smartest, sweetest, sassiest person I know.  She beats me at board games 80% of the time, and even so, I keep coming back for more.  She has an infectious way of beeing happy thoughout life, even when things aren't looking the brightest.</p>

              <p>Chistina's lust for life/travel/adventure/food/drink adds a silver lining to my life that I didn't know could be there.</p>

              <p><em>... oh, and she's easy on the eyes too.</em></p>
