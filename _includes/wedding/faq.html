              <strong><p id="faq_question_1" class="animation delay fadeInUp" onclick="$('#faq_answer_1').toggle(1000)">What exactly am I supposed to wear to your "rustic forest picnic wedding"?</p></strong>

              <div align="left" id="faq_answer_1">
                <p>Everyone should, of course, feel free to wear whatever they think is best... but for those of you hoping for some guidance, please read the advice below:</p>
                <p>For ladies, we recommend going for the "garden party" look. If you type the words “what to wear to a garden party” into Google (well at least Google.co.uk) there will be an endless amount of ideas and recommendations.  And don’t overthink it! If you love your outfit, so will we.</p>
                <p>For gentleman, we’re not too worried about you overthinking it.  This is a "special occasion", but is not a "suit and tie" affair. Some options could be black pants and a collared shirt (with suspenders) or khaki pants and a vest.</p>
                   
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Tip #1</strong> Don’t wear spiked heels (just trust us).  If you want to wear heels, go for a wedge.</li>
                  <li><strong>Tip #2</strong> Bring/Wear layers</li>
                  <li><strong>Tip #3</strong> Gentlemen, bonus points if you go for the “Mumford and Sons look” aka the <a href="http://www.eraudiofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/mumford_sons1.jpg" target="_blank">rustic hipster.</a></li>
                  <li><strong>Tip #4</strong> Ladies: When in doubt, just think "What would Kate Middleton wear?"</li>
                </ul>

              <strong><p id="faq_question_2" class="animation delay1 fadeInUp" onclick="$('#faq_answer_2').toggle(1000)">So... you guys didn’t send out “traditional” invitations- all I got was this magnet with a website on it- so I don’t know whether or not I get to bring a guest.</p></strong>

              <div align="left" id="faq_answer_2" >
                <p>As we like to think of ourselves as incredibly welcoming and generous people…everyone invited to the wedding (who was not mailed their invitation as a couple) is welcome to bring a guest as their date. We’d recommend bringing someone that a) you actually like as a person b) does not hate romance and/or nerdy things c) will not be intimidated by all the amazing people coming to this wedding.</p>

              <strong><p id="faq_question_3" class="animation delay2 fadeInUp" onclick="$('#faq_answer_3').toggle(1000)">Are children invited/allowed at the wedding?</p></strong>

              <div align="left" id="faq_answer_3" >
                <p>This wedding is 100% a  family affair, so children are of course welcome, and there will be lots of activities for them to enjoy at the reception. All we ask is for anyone with very little ones to use their best judgment regarding the ceremony.  For example, if your little one is in a stage where there is constant crying, perhaps it is best for them to skip the ceremony and come straight to the reception instead (this rule also applies to adults).</p>

              <strong><p id="faq_question_4" class="animation delay3 fadeInUp" onclick="$('#faq_answer_4').toggle(1000)">I have a dietary restriction and am concerned I will not be able to eat anything at the wedding and in turn will be miserable the whole time and spend the rest of my days resenting the two of you and your unholy union.</p></strong>

              <div align="left" id="faq_answer_4" >
                <p>Well, that’s not really a question... BUT, not to worry, we will have enough of a variety of food to meet anyone’s restrictions list.  We will have two food vendors and between them there will be gluten-free, dairy-free, and meat-free food options. We can’t guarantee that it’ll be perfect and exactly what you’d order were you at a restaurant…but you definitely won’t go hungry.</p>

              <strong><p id="faq_question_5" class="animation delay4 fadeInUp" onclick="$('#faq_answer_5').toggle(1000)">I can’t make it to your wedding... will you hate me forever?</p></strong>

              <div align="left" id="faq_answer_5" >
                <p>Yes.</p>

                <p>Hmmm... of course not! We completely understand that there are so very many factors that often make it too difficult to attend a wedding. If we invited you, it means we’d love for you to come, but it does not mean you are obligated to, so don’t feel badly. All we ask is that you let us know you can’t make it (either through the RSVP or through a call/email) and we hope another opportunity will come in the near future for us to hang out.</p>

              <strong><p id="faq_question_6" class="animation delay5 fadeInUp" onclick="$('#faq_answer_6').toggle(1000)">I’ve taken a look at your registry and it seems like you haven’t registered for that many items and that instead of a Honeyfund, you’ve opted for a Housefund. What’s up with that?</p></strong>

              <div align="left" id="faq_answer_6" >
                <p>The glory of getting married in your 30s means that you already actually own most of those “grown-up” items that usually fill up registries. The two of us already own nice plates and wine glasses, heck, we even have a porch swing (pictured below). When putting together our registry, we limited ourselves to things that we actually wanted or needed and that were also of use to both, not just one of us.  This didn't leave us with many options. As for the House vs. Honey fund…our 6 months in Europe and our many trips while out there were our honeymoon. Our next big (and incredibly exciting) step as a couple (after this whole wedding business) will be buying a house and thus the Housefund.</p>

              <strong><p id="faq_question_7" class="animation delay6 fadeInUp" onclick="$('#faq_answer_7').toggle(1000)">Ummmm...aren't you two already married?</p></strong>

              <div align="left" id="faq_answer_7" >
                <p>Yes! While we were living in Europe we just couldn't wait to get married, and so we eloped! We feel like our wedding has two parts, the first one (the Scottish elopement) was all about romance. The second part (this Bay Area wedding) is focused on celebration and, of course, our friends and family.
