              <h2>Evan</h2>
              <p><em>(as described by Christina)</em></p>

              <p>Evan makes everything around him better and me a better person by being with him. He’s that type of person that is just innately good (but somehow manages to also have a sarcastic sense of humor, be a cutthroat boardgame player, and a handsome devil to boot). Evan is the kind of guy who you always know without a doubt will be there for you... and I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life being there for him.</p>

              <h2>Christina</h2>
              <p><em>(as described by Evan)</em></p>

              <p>Christina is the smartest, sweetest, sassiest person I know.  She beats me at board games 80% of the time, and even so, I keep coming back for more.  She has an infectious way of being happy thoughout life, even when things aren't looking the brightest.</p>

              <p>Chistina's lust for life/travel/adventure/food/drink adds a silver lining to my life that I didn't know could be there.</p>

              <p><em>... oh, and she's easy on the eyes too.</em></p>
