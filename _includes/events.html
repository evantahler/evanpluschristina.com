              <h3>Wedding Ceremonty & Reception FAQ:</h3>
              <p>Congratulations! You are coming (hopefully?) to our wedding! We don't know everything yet about our oh-so-very-special-day...but this handy FAQ will serve as the appetizer to satiate your ravenous nuptial information appetite.</p>

              <p><strong>1) What type of wedding is this going to be exactly?</strong></p>
              <p>This is going to be a fun, lovely, casual, outdoor park wedding. </p>

              <p><strong>2) Where/What the heck is Loma Mar?</strong></p> 
              <p>It is a beautiful town near the coast; well, basically it’s a forest with some cabins (population 167). It is home to the Memorial County Park and is down the road from the town of Pescadero, where Christina and Evan went on their first “outside of SF” date. It’s within 1.5 hours of San Francisco (and even closer for you Peninsula folks). <br> 
              *Yes, there are Redwoods and mountain lions.</p>

              <p><strong>3) Wait, is this a Sunday?</strong></p>
              <p>Yup! Like Etta James said...we want a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byDIBzbDfok">Sunday kind of love.</a></p>

              <p><strong>4) Hey, aren’t you guys going to Europe or something?</strong></p>
              <p>Yes, indeed we are! We’ll be leaving at the end of February for London and plan on being back in late August/early September. </p>

              <p><strong>5)  I’m going to be coming from out of town, what day should I plan on arriving?</strong></p>
              <p>Right now we are still working out plans/logistics for the “wedding weekend.” Our current idea though is to have a “big night out” in San Francisco on the Friday night beforehand and then low-key drinks in Half Moon Bay on the Saturday night (but both will be completely optional). </p>

              <p><strong>6) Ummm...so there are no hotels in Loma Mar, where should I plan on staying?</strong></p>
              <p>We’ll be sending out more information regarding this in a couple of months. For those who live in the Bay Area and don’t feel like paying for a hotel, the benefits of a 11:30am-5:30pm wedding is that you don’t have to stay anywhere overnight. For those coming from out of town, we will be sending out a “recommended list” of inns/hotels in Half Moon Bay and Pescadero. </p>

              <p><strong>7)  Why did you choose to send an electronic Save the Date?</strong></p>
              <p>As the majority of our time is currently wrapped up with “the big London move” and getting the essential details settled for the wedding...going the online route just made the most sense. It’s also the handiest way of collecting everyone’s mailing addresses (you know, for the invitations).  It’s also greener… and nerdier.  </p>

              <p><strong>8) Are kids allowed at this wedding?</strong></p>
              <p>What? Kids in a park!? Parks are clearly only for adults.
              In all seriousness, yes, we would love for your children to be a part of this wonderful occasion (rumor has it they are the future).  We would suggest, however, helping them gain an appreciation of bluegrass/folk music ASAP. </p>

              <p><strong>9) When will we be getting more information about the wedding?</strong></p>
              <p>Early August.   Waiting makes the heart grow fonder.</p>

              <p><strong>10) What should I wear?</strong></p>
              <p>Something nice.  You don't have to wear a suit/ballgown, but you can.  You will be outside, in CA, all day... so make sure that you are comfortable above all else!</p>
